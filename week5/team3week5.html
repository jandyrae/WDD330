 Get the details
When we touch a hike it would be good if it showed us the full details for that hike. Make it so. Replace the list of hikes with a detailed view of one hike.

 Getting Back to our list
Add a "back" button/link that will take you from the hike details back to the main list.-->

    <main><header></header>
