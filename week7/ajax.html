    Chapter Summary
    <br><br>
Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.
<br>
The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.
<br>
Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload.
<br>
Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.
<br>
Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.
<br>
The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request or to create your own response objects.
<br>
The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information about the request being made, such as the URL and headers.
<br>
The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added to a request or response object.
<br>
Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.
<br>
The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.
